# SlapJack

### Rules are simple
1. Both players take turns flipping over the next card on the deck into the pile of flipped over cards.
2. When a Jack is flipped over, the player first to smack the Jack wins the deck of flipped cards.
3. The game ends when all 4 Jacks have been flipped over and the person with the most amount of cards wins the game.
4. If a player smacks the cards but the card was not a Jack, that player loses 5 points, and yes the points can go negative.

### Controls
#### How do we flip over the cards?
- Click on the deck.
#### How do we slap the Jack?
- If the current card is a Jack, each player must press their respective button. Player 1 is 'Spacebar' and Player 2 is 'Enter'
